Split into LH_RH
For each hand - key ordering goes Thumb(T), Pointer(P), Middle(M), Index(I), Pinky(Y), Palm(A)
For each finger - key orderings go in top to bottom placement order on the instrument

#TODO: Handle optional keys - encode for bari sax / soprano + added keys for tenor/alto
#TODO: Palm keys - assign D# and F to palm or fingers?

Encodings based of pedagogy books: Find links for backup that this fingering is widely taught

Get encodings of all fingerings - #TODO
Possible interesting avenue to explore when I have the data: which encoding minimizes difference between
empirical 'difficulty' and distance between encodings

Encode G# -> other left pinky intervals with ability to stay with left pinky on the same key as an option

Categories:
Assign each possible trill into groups based on
- Which hands change
- Octave jump?
- Finger changes position
